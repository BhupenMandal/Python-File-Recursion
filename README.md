# Python-File-Recursion

## Task Description
For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

## Explanation
As suggested by the problem screen, using the "OS" module helps with interacting with the Operating system. The module has amazing and easy to use tools for redirecting the current directory and searching paths and files with given parameters. The recognized files and paths are then stored in a simple list named as “recog_data”. 

Contains for loops and scans the directories and sub-directories for files ending with “.c “. For this reason, both the time and space complexities are O(m*n)
